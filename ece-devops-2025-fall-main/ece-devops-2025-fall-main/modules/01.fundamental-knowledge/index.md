# Fundamental knowledge

## Common tools

### Software installation

Install the following software on your computer:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Terminal

- Most useful developer tool
- Any number of customizations
- On Windows: Linux Bash Shell, Powershell, Git Bash (don't use default CMD!)
- On macOS / Linux: native Terminal

### Bash

Learn Bash base commands:

- [Bash base commands](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet)
- [GameShell: a "game" to teach the Unix shell](https://github.com/phyver/GameShell)

### Vi(m)

- Bash text editor
- Use `:` to enter command mode
  - `w` to write file
  - `q` to quit
  - `q!` to quit without saving
  - `x` to write & quit
- Use `/` to search for text
- Use `i` to enter edit mode and `ESC` to exit it
- `vimtutor` is the best tutorial to learn

### Password manager

- Using a password manager is mandatory
- [Buttercup](https://buttercup.pw/)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

## Networking

### Client VS Server

- Two parts of a distributed computing model:
  - Client requests the info and displays it
  - Server processes the request and services the result
- We will do server work + a bit of client-side

### The IP protocol

- Send data from one computer to another over a network (ex: client/server)
- Use of IPV4 addresses (ex: 172.16.254.1), IPV6 also available but not much used
- Data packaged in IP packets with 2 sections
  - Header: IP version, addresses, TTL, ...
  - Data: the packet's content

### The HTTP protocol

- Application protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents (HTML)
- Two types of messages: *requests- & *responses*
- HTTP message split between *headers- & *body*
- HTTP response always contains
  - the *protocol- (HTTP/1.1)
  - a *status code- (200, 404, ...)
  - a *status text- (page not found)

### API and REST API

- Application Programming Interface (API)
- In web: REST API
  - Expose a set of HTTP routes
  - Use HTTP verbs (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE)
  - Client connects to communicate
  - Usually communicating in JSON
  
REST API example: https://petstore.swagger.io/
  
### SSL/TLS & HTTPS

(Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)
- Establish an encrypted link over a network
- Exchange of public & private keys to secure the exchange
  - Server sends SSL certificate + public key
  - Client checks the certificate & answers with an encrypted session key
  - Client & server exchange messages encrypted with the keys to authenticate
- SSL certificate has been certified by a renowned authority
- HTTPS: HTTP secured with SSL/TLS

### SSH - Secure shell

- Cryptographic network protocol to operate network services securely over an unsecured network
- Exchange of public & private keys to secure the exchange
  - Client has the private key
  - Server needs to have the associated public key
  - Client & server exchange messages encrypted with the keys to authenticate

### The SFTP protocol

- Send files over SSH
- ex: deploy a website to a server
- SFTP apps: FileZilla, Cyberduck, WinSCP, ...

## Progamming tools

### Databases

- RDBMS (basis for SQL): MySQL, PostgreSQL, Hive, Oracle
- NoSQL:
  - Filesystems: posix and object storage
  - Documents store: MongoDB, ElasticSearch
  - Key/value and sorted key/value stores: Redis, LevelDB
  - Column families: HBase, Cassandra
  - Graph DBs: JanusGraph (ex-TitanDB), Neo4J

### Editors, IDE

As a developer, the terminal being your partner and the editor is your best friend: 

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (Linux, macOS, Windows)   
  Free, one of the most powerful, many will say the most powerful, single file or project-oriented.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Linux, macOS, Windows)   
  Free project-oriented, minimalist, and productive UI (my day to day favorite editor), slow and memory hungry
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Linux, macOS, Windows)   
  Free most popular editor, most active community, and plugins development
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (Linux, macOS, Windows)   
  Free, very fast, single file or project-oriented
- [BBedit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (macOS)   
  Free version very powerful, very fast
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) Windows)   
  Free, almost a Windows standard, powerful and fast
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  Licensed, 30 days trial
- ...

### Gravatar

- Globally Recognized   
  Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) provides a universal avatar service that links user avatars to their email addresses, making them visible across participating sites.
- Ease of Use   
  Users can create a Gravatar account and upload an avatar once, which will automatically appear on all sites that support Gravatar, enhancing consistency and recognition.
- Widely Supported   
  Many popular websites and applications, including WordPress, GitHub, and Stack Overflow, integrate with Gravatar to display user avatars.
- Personal Branding   
  Gravatar helps in personal branding by ensuring that your chosen image appears alongside your content across the web, providing a cohesive and professional online presence.

## Common Knowledge

### Programmation paradigms

- Declarative   
  The program describes its desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps.
- Imperative   
  The control flow is an explicit sequence of commands.
- Functional   
  The computation proceeds by function calls, no global state
- Object-oriented   
  Everything is an object, functions are methods and are executed with the object's context
- Event-driven   
  The control flow is triggered and determined by async actions
- Fluent API   
  Chaining method calls in a readable, fluid manner.
- Pure function   
  A function that, given the same inputs, always produces the same output and has no side effects, not altering any state or data outside its scope.

### Communities

- HackerNews
  - Most qualified community
  - Large technological scope coverage
- StackOverflow
  - Huge data source
  - Reactive community
  - Any subject
  - Lots of answered questions (> 1M !)
  - Donâ€™t forget the source code!
- Dev.to, Medium
  - Blog publications

## Languages

### Markdown

- Simple Syntax   
  Markdown uses easy-to-read, plain text formatting syntax that can be quickly learned and applied.
- Versatility   
  It can be used to create formatted text for web pages, documents, notes, and more.
- Compatibility   
  Markdown files can be converted to various formats such as HTML, PDF, and Word.
- Lightweight   
  As a plain text format, Markdown is lightweight and doesn't require special software to read or write.
- Widespread Use   
  Popular platforms like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow support Markdown, making it a valuable skill.
- Improves Workflow   
  It enhances productivity by allowing writers and developers to focus on content without worrying about complex formatting.

### JSON format

- JSON is a subset of JavaScript, JavaScript is built upon JSON
- Data format

Valid JavaScript:

```js
const user = {
  firstname: 'Lucky',
  lastname: `Luke`,
  "password": "secret",
  age: 42,
  mood: 0.9,
  languages: ['en', ['fr_FR', 'fr_CA'] , , ],
  level: null,
  friends: undefined,
};
```

Valid JSON:

```json
{
  "firstname": "Lucky",
  "lastname": "Luke",
  "password": "secret",
  "age": 42,
  "mood": 0.9,
  "languages": ["en", ["fr_FR", "fr_CA"]],
  "level": null
}
```

### YAML format

- Human-readable data-serialization format
- Indentations are important!
- *"Yet Another Markup Language"*
- A JSON extention, JSON is YAML, YAML is not JSON

The same as above JSON, but YAML:

```yml
firstname: Lucky
lastname: Luke
password: secret
age: 42
mood: 0.9
languages:
  - en
  - - fr_FR
    - fr_CA
level:
```
